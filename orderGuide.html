                            <span style="font-weight: bold">A. Why do you need to re-order?</span><br>
                            As we know, different engineers will deal with PCB file in different way so that some
                            details of your new PCB orders will be different. If you want to order the same boards as
                            the samples which you placed in PCBGOGO, you need to re-order it instead of placing new
                            order. So
                            that your order will be dealt with by the same engineer as your sample order and it will be
                            same as your sample.
